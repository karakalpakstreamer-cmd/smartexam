Show me the server console logs when I try to create a test. What is the actual error message? Add console.log statements to the test creation function and see exactly where it fails. and figure out why it doesn't work.
An error occurred while creating the test. The error message says "An error occurred while creating the test."

From the screenshot I can see that all the information is filled in correctly:
- Exam name: “History Exam”
- Subject: “History”
- Date: 11/30/2025
- Time: 09:00
- Duration: 60 minutes
- Questions for the ticket: 5
- Selected groups: 304-22 (4th year), 306-22 (4th year)
- Available questions: 50
- Question topic: “Topic 1: Introduction” with 10 questions

But when you click on the create button, it shows a red error notification.

Please fix this by checking the following:

## 1. CHECK THE BACKEND ERROR LOGS

Look at the server console to find the actual error message. The frontend only shows a generic error, but the real problem is in the backend.

## 2. COMMON REASONS TO CHECK:

### Database issues:
- Check that the Exams table exists and has the correct columns
- Check that the Exam_tickets table exists
- Check that the Exam_sessions table exists
- Make sure that all foreign key relationships are correct

### Data validation issues:
- Check that target_groups is being sent as an array of integers
- Check that the Subject_id is being sent correctly
- Check that the teacher_id is being retrieved from the session
- Check that the date and time format for PostgreSQL is correct

### Ticket creation issues:
- Check that there are enough questions in the database for the selected subject
- The system needs at least (number of students × 5) questions to create unique tickets
- Check that the questions are being retrieved from the Questions table correctly

### Session/Authentication issues:
- Teacher session make sure it is valid
- Check that the teacher_id is being passed to the exam creation function correctly

## 3. ADD BETTER ERRORS

Please add a detailed error log to the exam creation endpoint so we can see exactly what is failing:

Add a try-catch with detailed error messages in the exam creation route:
- Which step failed (exam record creation, ticket creation, session creation)
- Actual database error message
- Data being processed when the error occurred

## 4. TEST THE DEVELOPMENT

After fixing, test it by creating an exam:
- Exam name: "Test exam"
- Any topic with questions
- Select at least one group
- Set the date to tomorrow
- Set the time to 09:00
- Duration: 60 minutes

The exam should be successfully created and appear in the exam list.

## 5. ALSO CHECK:

- Make sure the questions table contains questions with the correct subject_id
- Make sure the selected groups contain students
- Make sure the exam_tickets creation logic handles edge cases

Please check the server logs, find the exact error, fix it, and verify the exam creation efforts.
