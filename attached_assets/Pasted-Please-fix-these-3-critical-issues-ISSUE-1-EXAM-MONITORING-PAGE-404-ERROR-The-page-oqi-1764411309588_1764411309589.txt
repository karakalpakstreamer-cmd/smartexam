Please fix these 3 critical issues:

## ISSUE 1: EXAM MONITORING PAGE - 404 ERROR

The page /oqituvchi/imtihonlar/:id/monitoring returns 404 error. This page was not created.

Please create the Exam Monitoring page with these features:

### Route: /oqituvchi/imtihonlar/:id/monitoring

### Header Section:
- Back button to return to exams list
- Exam name and subject name
- Large countdown timer showing remaining time
- "Imtihonni tugatish" button (red, ends exam for all students)

### Statistics Bar:
- Jami talabalar: [total count]
- Boshlagan: [started count]
- Topshirgan: [submitted count]
- Muammoli: [count with warnings] (red if > 0)

### Main Content - Student Grid:
Show a card for each student assigned to this exam:
- Student avatar (initials)
- Student name
- Group name
- Status badge:
  - Gray: "Kutmoqda" (not started)
  - Blue with pulse: "Yozmoqda" (in progress)
  - Green: "Topshirdi" (submitted)
  - Red: "Chetlashtirildi" (disqualified)
- Progress indicator: "3/5 savol" (questions answered)
- Time spent: "15:32"
- Warning badge if tab_switches > 0 (show count like "⚠️ 2")

### Alerts Panel (right side):
Real-time activity feed showing:
- "[Student name] imtihonni boshladi" - with timestamp
- "[Student name] 3-savolni javobladi" - with timestamp
- "[Student name] sahifadan chiqdi (1/3)" - yellow warning
- "[Student name] sahifadan chiqdi (3/3) - CHETLASHTIRILDI" - red alert
- "[Student name] imtihonni topshirdi" - green, with timestamp

### Auto-refresh:
- Page should refresh data every 5-10 seconds automatically
- Show "Yangilandi: 14:35:22" timestamp

### Actions:
- Click on student card to see their current answers (read-only)
- "Vaqt qo'shish" button to add extra time for all students
- "Imtihonni tugatish" button to force-end the exam

## ISSUE 2: EXAM SUBMISSION IS SLOW AND FREEZING

When student clicks "Tugatish" button, the page freezes and takes too long. Sometimes it shows late error messages.

Please fix the submission process:

### Problem: The submission is doing too much at once
The system is probably trying to:
1. Save all answers
2. Call AI grading API for all 5 questions
3. Wait for all AI responses
4. Update database

This is too slow and causes freezing.

### Solution: Split into two parts

PART A - Immediate submission (fast, under 2 seconds):
1. Save all answers to student_answers table
2. Update exam_session status to 'submitted'
3. Set submitted_at timestamp
4. Redirect to success page immediately
5. Show "Imtihon topshirildi!" message

PART B - Background AI grading (happens after redirect):
1. AI grading should happen in the background
2. Student does not wait for AI grading
3. Use async processing or queue system
4. Update ai_score when grading completes
5. Teacher sees results when grading is done

### Also fix:
- Add loading spinner on "Tugatish" button when clicked
- Disable button after click to prevent double-submission
- Set timeout - if submission takes more than 10 seconds, show error
- Add "Qayta urinish" button if submission fails

## ISSUE 3: FALSE WARNING WHEN CLICKING SUBMIT

When student clicks "Tugatish" button, a tab-switch warning appears incorrectly. This should not happen.

### The problem:
The tab-switch detection is probably triggering when:
- Opening the confirmation modal
- The button click event
- Some internal page state change

### Solution:
Add exceptions to the tab-switch detection:

1. Do NOT count as tab-switch when:
   - Confirmation modal is open
   - Student is clicking "Tugatish" button
   - Submission is in progress
   - Page is redirecting to success page

2. Add a flag like "isSubmitting" that disables tab-switch detection during submission

3. Only detect REAL tab switches:
   - document.hidden becomes true (browser tab changed)
   - window loses focus to EXTERNAL application
   - NOT internal modal/dialog interactions

### Code logic should be:
- When "Tugatish" clicked: set isSubmitting = true
- While isSubmitting = true: ignore all tab-switch events
- After redirect to success: tab-switch detection not needed
