The student has accepted the exam rules (checkbox is checked), but the exam is not starting. The page shows "Imtihon hali boshlanmadi. Iltimos, belgilangan vaqtni kuting." and "Boshlanish vaqti: 14:22:00" but even after this time arrives, there is no button to start the exam.

Please fix the following issues:

## ISSUE 1: NO START BUTTON APPEARS

After the student accepts the rules and the exam start time arrives, there should be a "Imtihonni boshlash" (Start Exam) button. This button is missing.

Please add:
- A prominent "Imtihonni boshlash" button that appears when:
  1. The checkbox is checked (student accepted rules)
  2. Current time is equal to or after the exam start time
- The button should be large, blue, and clearly visible
- When clicked, it should redirect to the active exam interface

## ISSUE 2: TIME COMPARISON IS NOT WORKING

The system is not correctly comparing the current time with the exam start time.

Please fix the time comparison logic:
- Get the current time from the user's browser
- Compare it with the exam's start_time from the database
- If current time >= exam start time, show the start button
- If current time < exam start time, show the countdown message

Important: Make sure to handle timezone correctly. The exam time in the database should match the user's local time.

## ISSUE 3: EXAM STATUS CHECK

The system should also check if the exam status is "active" or "scheduled":
- If exam status is "scheduled" and current time >= start time, automatically change status to "active"
- If exam status is "active", allow students to start
- If exam status is "completed" or "cancelled", show appropriate message

## ISSUE 4: ADD REAL-TIME UPDATE

The page should automatically check every few seconds if the exam can be started:
- Check every 5-10 seconds if current time has reached start time
- When start time is reached, automatically show the "Imtihonni boshlash" button
- No need to refresh the page manually

## EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:

Before exam time:
- Show: "Imtihon hali boshlanmadi. Iltimos, belgilangan vaqtni kuting."
- Show: Countdown timer to start time
- Button: Disabled or hidden

When exam time arrives (and checkbox is checked):
- Show: "Imtihon boshlashga tayyor!"
- Button: "Imtihonni boshlash" (enabled, blue, prominent)

When student clicks "Imtihonni boshlash":
- Enter fullscreen mode
- Redirect to /talaba/imtihon/:id (active exam interface)
- Start the countdown timer
- Show first question

## ALSO CHECK:

- Make sure the exam was created successfully in the database
- Make sure the student has an assigned ticket for this exam
- Make sure there are questions in the assigned ticket
- Check if there are any console errors in the browser

Please fix these issues so students can start their exams when the scheduled time arrives.
