There is a SQL syntax error when student clicks "Imtihonni boshlash" button.

Error message: 400: {"error":"syntax error at or near \"=\""}

This is a database query syntax error. Please find and fix the SQL query that runs when starting an exam.

## WHERE TO LOOK:

The error occurs when the student clicks "Imtihonni boshlash" button. This likely happens in one of these operations:

1. Updating the exam_sessions table to set status = 'in_progress'
2. Getting the student's assigned ticket
3. Getting the questions for the ticket
4. Recording the exam start time

## COMMON SQL SYNTAX MISTAKES TO CHECK:

### Problem 1: Missing quotes around string values
Wrong: UPDATE exam_sessions SET status = in_progress
Correct: UPDATE exam_sessions SET status = 'in_progress'

### Problem 2: Using = instead of IS for NULL
Wrong: WHERE ticket_id = NULL
Correct: WHERE ticket_id IS NULL

### Problem 3: Missing commas between SET values
Wrong: UPDATE exam_sessions SET status = 'in_progress' started_at = NOW()
Correct: UPDATE exam_sessions SET status = 'in_progress', started_at = NOW()

### Problem 4: Wrong parameter placeholder
Wrong: WHERE id = $ 1 (space before number)
Correct: WHERE id = $1 (no space)

### Problem 5: Empty or undefined values in query
Wrong: WHERE student_id = (undefined becomes empty)
Correct: Make sure student_id is passed correctly

## PLEASE DO THE FOLLOWING:

1. Find the API endpoint that handles POST /api/exams/:id/start or similar
2. Look at all SQL queries in that function
3. Check each query for syntax errors
4. Make sure all string values have quotes
5. Make sure all parameters are passed correctly
6. Add console.log to print the actual SQL query being executed
7. Fix the syntax error

## EXAMPLE OF CORRECT QUERIES:

Starting exam session:
UPDATE exam_sessions 
SET status = 'in_progress', started_at = NOW() 
WHERE exam_id = $1 AND student_id = $2

Getting student's ticket:
SELECT * FROM exam_tickets 
WHERE exam_id = $1 AND assigned_to = $2

Getting questions for ticket:
SELECT q.* FROM questions q 
WHERE q.id = ANY($1)

## AFTER FIXING:

Test by clicking "Imtihonni boshlash" again. The student should enter the fullscreen exam interface and see the first question.

Please find the exact query with the syntax error and fix it.
