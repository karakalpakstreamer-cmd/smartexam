Please fix the following critical issues in SmartExam. The main goal is to complete ONE FULL PROCESS from teacher creating exam to student taking exam.

## ISSUE 1: TEACHER PANEL - EXAM CREATION ERROR AT FINAL STEP

The teacher panel is mostly working, but there is an error at the final step when creating an exam.

Please check and fix:
- The "Imtihonni yaratish" (Create Exam) button at the final step (Step 3 - Ko'rib chiqish)
- Check if the exam data is being saved correctly to the database
- Check if the exam tickets are being generated properly
- Check if students are being assigned to the exam correctly
- Make sure all required fields are validated before submission
- Show proper success message after exam is created
- Redirect teacher to exam list after successful creation

The exam creation flow should work like this:
Step 1: Teacher enters basic info (name, subject, type, groups, date, time, duration)
Step 2: Teacher configures questions (5 questions per ticket, points per question)
Step 3: Teacher reviews all settings and clicks "Imtihonni yaratish"
Result: Exam is created, unique tickets are generated for each student, exam appears in the list

Please check the console for any error messages and fix them.
