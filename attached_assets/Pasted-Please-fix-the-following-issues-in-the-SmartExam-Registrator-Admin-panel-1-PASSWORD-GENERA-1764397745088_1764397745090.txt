Please fix the following issues in the SmartExam Registrator (Admin) panel:

## 1. PASSWORD GENERATION - CHANGE THE FORMAT

Current system generates random passwords like "Kj8nM3pX" - this is wrong.

New format required:
- For Teacher ID T001, password should be: passwordt001
- For Teacher ID T002, password should be: passwordt002
- For Student ID S001, password should be: passwords001
- For Student ID S002, password should be: passwords002

The password format is always: "password" + user ID in lowercase letters.
This makes it easy for users to remember their first password.

## 2. PASSWORD RESET - NOT WORKING

The "Parol yangilash" (Password Reset) button does not work when clicked.
Please fix this feature so administrators can reset user passwords.
When password is reset, new password should follow the same format: "password" + user ID in lowercase.

## 3. GROUPS - ADD LANGUAGE FIELD

When creating a new group, there is no option to select the language of instruction.

Please add a new dropdown field called "Til" (Language) with these options:
- O'zbek guruhi
- Qoraqalpoq guruhi
- Rus guruhi

This field should be required when creating a group and should be displayed in the groups list table.

## 4. SUBJECTS - ADD GROUP ASSIGNMENT

When creating a new subject, there is no way to assign it to specific groups.

Please add a multi-select field to choose which groups will study this subject.
The groups should be displayed with full information, for example: "AT-xizmat 4-kurs Rus guruhi"

This helps teachers know which exact groups are taking their subject.

## 5. STUDENTS - SHOW LANGUAGE IN GROUP DROPDOWN

When adding a new student and selecting their group, the dropdown only shows group name.

Please update the dropdown to show the language too, for example:
- "101-guruh (O'zbek guruhi)"
- "102-guruh (Qoraqalpoq guruhi)"
- "103-guruh (Rus guruhi)"

This helps administrators assign students to the correct language group.

## 6. DASHBOARD STATISTICS - ALL SHOWING ZERO

The dashboard statistics cards are broken. They all show 0 even though we have added data:
- Total users: Shows 0 (should show actual count)
- Subjects: Shows 0 (should show actual count)
- Students: Shows 0 (should show actual count)
- Groups: Shows 0 (should show actual count)

Please check the database queries and fix them to correctly count and display the real numbers from the database.

## 7. SETTINGS PAGE - RETURNS 404 ERROR

When clicking on "Sozlamalar" (Settings) in the sidebar, it shows a 404 error page.
This page was never created.

Please create a Settings page with these sections:
- Tizim sozlamalari (System Settings): Platform name, logo upload
- Xavfsizlik (Security): Password policy settings
- Ma'lumotlar (Data): Export/backup options

2. Fix the password reset button functionality
3. Add language selection field when creating groups
